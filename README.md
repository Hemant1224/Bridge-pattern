# Bridge-pattern

The Bridge Pattern is a structural design pattern that decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently. It is particularly useful when you have a hierarchy of abstractions and a hierarchy of implementations, and you want to be able to mix and match them in different combinations.
The key components of the Bridge Pattern are:

Abstraction (also called the "Bridge"): This is the interface that defines the common operations for all concrete implementations. It maintains a reference to the Implementor object and delegates all implementation-specific operations to it.
Refined Abstraction: This is an optional level of abstraction that provides additional functionality by extending the Abstraction.
Implementor: This is the interface that defines the implementation-specific operations. It is decoupled from the Abstraction, allowing multiple implementations to exist.
Concrete Implementor: This is the actual implementation of the Implementor interface.
